Surveillance Car using ESP32 Camera Module

The Surveillance Car using the ESP32 Cam module is a project that 
involves building a remote-controlled car equipped with a camera 
for surveillance purposes. The ESP32 Cam module, based on the 
ESP32 microcontroller, provides both the processing power and the 
capability to capture and stream video. The project allows users 
to remotely control the car over Wi-Fi, view live video footage, 
and potentially implement additional features for surveillance and 
exploration.
